Our training equips them with the necessary Agility and Alertness, Physical and Mental competence needed to excel and leave their mark in the fiercely competitive world ahead.",

  motto:
    'A person having four vedas (knowledge) in front (to guide him), a bow and arrows (power) at his back (to back him) has a combination of "Brahmyam" and "Kshatram" and hence he is capable of defeating the enemies either by "Shap" (Power of Knowledge) or "Shar" (Knowledge of Power)',
  conclusion:
    'Thus, the aim of the school is to impart "Power of knowledge" and "Knowledge of Power" to the youth. And hence the school gives emphasis on both, academic and military training.',
  note: `Since our aim is to inculcate military virtues in the youth in general, it is not obligatory on part of the students of the school to join the services. However, those who are really willing to join the noble profession of "Arms" will certainly find our training useful towards their aim. Whereas the rest will find themselves mentally and physically fit to pursue any career in the present competitive world.`,
