          Army and Navy Academy is a military school for boys that is centered
          on a unique and singular mission: to forge virtue in young men for
          life. We feel that cultivating academic excellence and training
          exceptional scholar-athletes is the bare minimum of what a military
          boarding school should do. Our focus on virtue and character
          development makes us a unique opportunity for any young man looking to
          thrive in an increasingly challenging world.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base sm:text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          We prioritize virtue in all that we do, a fact that is reflected in
          the environment of dignity and respect that pervades our campus. Our
          core values of Honor, Integrity, Gratitude, Compassion, Respect, and
          Responsibility donâ€™t just guide our cadets: they are guidelines that
          help us all strive to uplift, serve, and inspire others.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base sm:text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          We are a certified kindness company, and our programming utilizes the
          strategies and outcomes of the Anti-Defamation League No Place for
          Hate program. Our commitment to cadet safety extends beyond physical
          security; it encompasses the emotional and social well-being of every
          member of our global campus.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
          We invite you to join us in doing our part to shape a world where
          human excellence is defined not only by achievement, but by character.
          Welcome to Army and Navy Academy, where greatness begins with virtue.
